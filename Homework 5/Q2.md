## Question 2

In the following expressions say which, if any, variables are bound (and to which λ), and which are free.

1. λs.s z λq.s q
```
Bound: s (first λ)
Free: s (second λ)
```
2. (λs. s z) λq. w λw. w q z s
```
Bound: s (first λ), w (third λ)
Free: w (second λ)
```
3. (λs.s) (λq.qs)
```
Bound: s (first λ), q (second λ)
Free: s (second λ)
```
4. λz. (((λs.sq) (λq.qz)) λz. (z z))
```
Bound: s (second λ), q (third λ), z (second λ)
Free: q (second λ), z (third λ)
```
