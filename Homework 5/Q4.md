## Question 4

1. Write the truth table for the or operator below.
```
OR 
a | b 
T | F T 
T | T T 
F | T T 
F | F F 
```

2. The Church encoding for OR = (λp.λq.p p q)

Prove that this is a valid "or" function by showing that its output matches the truth table above. You will have 4 derivations. For the first derivation, show the long-hand solution (don't use T and F, use their definitions). For the other 3 you may use the symbols in place of the definitions. 

## First case: T,T = T
```
(λp.λq.p p q)TT
= (λp.λq.p p q)(λxλy.x)(λxλy.x)
= {(λp.λq.p p q)(λxλy.x)}(λxλy.x)

Solving (λp.λq.p p q)(λxλy.x) first
(λp.λq.p p q)(λxλy.x)
= (λq.p p q)[p->(λxλy.x)]
= (λq.(λxλy.x)(λxλy.x) q)

Subbing it back into whole line:
{(λp.λq.p p q)(λxλy.x)}(λxλy.x)
= (λq.(λxλy.x)(λxλy.x) q) (λxλy.x)
= ((λxλy.x)(λxλy.x) q) [q->(λxλy.x)]
= ((λxλy.x)(λxλy.x)(λxλy.x))
= {((λxλy.x)(λxλy.x)}(λxλy.x))
= {((λy.x)[x->(λx'λy'.x')]}(λxλy.x))
= ((λy.(λx'λy'.x')(λx''λy''.x''))
= ((λx'λy'.x')[y->(λx''λy''.x'')])
= (λx'λy'.x')
= T
```
## Second Case: T,F T
```
(λp.λq.p p q)TF
= (λq. p p q)[p->T]F
= (λq. T T q)F
= ( T T q)[q->F]
= (T T F)
= T
```
## Third Case: F,T T
```
(λp.λq.p p q)FT
= (λq. p p q)[p->F]T
= (λq. F F q)T
= ( F F q)[q->T]
= (F F T)
= T
```
## Fourth Case: F,F F
```
(λp.λq.p p q)FF
= (λq. p p q)[p->F]F
= (λq. F F q)F
= ( F F q)[q->F]
= (F F F)
= F
