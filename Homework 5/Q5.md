## Question 5

Derive a lambda expression for the NOT operator. Explain how this is similar to an IF statement.

```
NOT operator: (λp.λa.λb.p b a)

If statement: (λp.λa.λb.p a b)

As can be seen, both the not operator and the if statement are very similar when it comes to church encoding, only differing by the last two variables. This difference results in the If statement working the opposite way of the NOT operator. If something is T, it returns T. On the other hand for the NOT operator, if it is T, it returns F. Therefore both are very concrete in returning a result based on a single input.
