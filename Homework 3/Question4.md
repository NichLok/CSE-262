### Question 4

Why is it difficult to tell whether a program is correct or not? How do you personally go about finding bugs in your code? What kinds of bugs are revealed by testing? What kind of bugs cannot be caught by testing?

```
It might be difficult to find whether a program is correct because the program might be fundamentally correct, but it might not achieve its intended purpose. For example 2 + 2 = 4 is correct, but maybe one might have wanted 2 * 2 = 4. Both give the same answer but the function is different.

A good way to find bugs is to create several test cases to are there to intentionally catch said bugs.

Bugs such as those mentioned above are harder to catch because the computer perceives the program as legitimate.
