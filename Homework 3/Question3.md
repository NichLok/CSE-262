### Question 3

In Rust, what is the limit on the value of a usize? What happens in the event of arithmetic overflow? Don't look this up, try and figure it out on your own. What are the implications of size limits on the portability of programs from one machine/compiler to another?

```
The limit of usize depends on the computer architecture that is being used. If a 64-bit computer system is used, then usize would be equivalent to u64.
